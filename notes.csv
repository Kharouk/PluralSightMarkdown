"Ethernet II Frame is like a packet but for Layer 2. It contains Data Link addresses (Dst. and Src. Addresses), and it might also contain Layer 3 data, called a **packet**.\n&nbsp;\nThis **packet** is the data we are transferring in the Frame. Everything is the frame information, that is used by Ethernet to understand where this **chunk of data, with a data link layer header**, is going.","Networking Concepts and Protocols","Ethernet and Switching","Ethernet II Frame","0:54","https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=comptia-network-plus-networking-concepts&author=ross-bagurdes&name=ed11004c-5a48-41c5-8c23-fbf46a0cdae2&clip=4&mode=live&start=54&noteid=2d0efd76-aea5-43ad-b5a6-b3ab7a0359bc"

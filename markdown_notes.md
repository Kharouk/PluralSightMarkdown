Half duplex means only one device can communicate at a time on #Ethernet - Duplex and Speed - 0:27
 Half duplex is really similar to walkie talkie. I can only talk or listen, not both. - Duplex and Speed - 0:36
 Full Duplex is more like a *telephone* communication, which means that two devices can communicate at a time and listen/talk simultaneously. - Duplex and Speed - 1:04
Full Duplex networks allow us not to worry about Collisions. - Duplex and Speed - 1:38
Modern Collision Domain: Half Duplex connection between a PC and a switch. \n\n- We might keep half duplex because we are dealing with an old device. \n\n- Might used experimentation. - Duplex and Speed - 1:55
Most modern networks are Full Duplex.  - Duplex and Speed - 2:34
Ethernet = 10Mbps - 1982\nFastEthernet = 100Mbps\nGigabitEthernet = 1Gbps - Common\n10GigabitEthernet = 10Gbps - Connects ISPs together - Duplex and Speed - 2:55
What hasn't changed since the creation of Ethernet is the **Frame**. Protocols changed, duplexes changed, but not Frame. - Ethernet II Frame - 0:23
Ethernet II Frame is like a packet but for Layer 2. It contains Data Link addresses (Dst. and Src. Addresses), and it might also contain Layer 3 data, called a **packet**.\n&nbsp;\nThis **packet** is the data we are transferring in the Frame. Everything is the frame information, that is used by Ethernet to understand where this **chunk of data, with a data link layer header**, is going. - Ethernet II Frame - 0:54
